# Link Tree Within a Site

## What
Inserts an easy-to-customize link tree popup inside a site.

## Why
Some sites can be annoying to navigate ("Where is the menu item for that thing?") and for sites you visit often this can be a big time suck. Traditional bookmarks are fine but then you have to remember to head to your bookmark bar. WHat if you could just program a site to show you some navigation you create? 

## How
Just use the "User Javascript and CSS" extension to insert the JS in this repository into any site you wish to create a link tree for. Modify the default code in the extension with the links you need to visit often in thsi site and modify the color and placement based your preference.
